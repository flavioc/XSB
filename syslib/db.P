/* This module contains routines that handle predicate and clause	*/
/* references, in order to support assert and retract in our system.	*/
/*									*/
/* A predicate reference (Prref) is a database reference to a sequence  */
/* of clauses. Normally a Prref is associated with a psc-entry 		*/
/* (in the e.p.  field), the psc entry of the main functor symbol of 	*/
/* all the clauses.  But that need not be the case. A Prref can be	*/
/* created, asserted to, and called explicitly. 			*/
/*									*/
/* See the description of the formats of these records in assert.P	*/
/*======================================================================*/

/*======================================================================*/
/* db_new_prref(+PSC,-Prref): 						*/
/*	creates an empty Prref, i.e.  one with no clauses in it.  	*/
/*	If called, it will simply fail.  Prref must be a variable at 	*/
/*	the time of call. It points the entry point of the psc record	*/
/*	pointed to by PSC to this Prref. So in effect it makes it	*/
/*	dynamic.	 						*/
