# This is a smart XSB invocation script. It senses 
# the current architecture and finds the right executable for it.
# Invoke as 'xsb${suffix} args'

# Don't move this script (except if you move it along with the 
# whole XSB source tree) and/or invoke it via links.
# This script assumes that it resides one level above the root
# of the XSB source tree. 
# If you need to invoke this (bin/xsb) script from some other location,
# put a simple shell script in that other location, which would simly
# call the bin/xsb script.
