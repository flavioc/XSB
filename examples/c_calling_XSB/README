This directory contains examples that show how to call XSB from C.

All these programs assume that they are compiled and placed in the XSB
directory for executables, $XSB_HOME/config/<your system architecture>/bin

***You must first execute "makexsb module" in the XSB/build directory***

The simplest way to compile these examples is to start XSB and then execute:

| ?- [make].

A sample Makefile for Linux is also provided but this may require some
tweaking. 

The Makefile specific to your architecture is placed in
    $XSB_HOME/config/<your system architecture>/modMakefile
after you build XSB.
You can use it to link your own programs with XSB. This make file
contains all the right settings, but you will have to fill in the actual
name of your program that calls the XSB module.
