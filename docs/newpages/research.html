<h1>The XSB Research Group</h1>

<p>The focus of the XSB research group is the development and
application of the XSB system, an open source logic programming system
that extends Prolog with new semantic and operational features, mostly
based on the use of Tabled Logic Programming or <i>tabling.</i></p>

<p>At first, tabling may seem like a simple idea. At a very high
level, during computation of a goal to a logic program, each subgoal
<i>S</i> is registered in a table the first time it is called, and
unique answers to <i>S </i>are added to the table as they are
derived. When subsequent calls are made to<i> S</i>, the evaluation
ensures that answers to <i>S </i>are read from the table rather than
being re-derived using program clauses. Even from this simple
description, a first advantage of tabling can be seen, that it
provides termination to various classes of programs. Consider the case
of ground positive datalog programs &mdash; i.e. Horn Clause programs that
allow only constant terms over a finite alphabet. Such a program
contains only finitely many ground atoms. Each of these atoms can be
added at most once to the table as a subgoal, and each such subgoal
can have at most one answer, leading to a finite computation. Tabled
logic programming for Horn clause programs was first formalized in the
early 1980's. Additionally, several formalisms and systems have been
based both on tabled resolution and on magic sets, which can also be
seen as a form of tabled logic programming.</p>

<p>However, tabling can be used to far greater effect than ensuring
termination for Horn clause programs. Seen abstractly, the table
described above represents selected global elements of a given state
of a computation, in this case, subgoals called and their answers so
far derived. One powerful feature of tabling is its ability to
maintain other global elements of a computation in the ``table,'' such
as information about whether one subgoal depends on another, and
whether the dependency is through negation. By maintaining this global
information, tabling can be used to evaluate normal logic programs
under the <i>Well-Founded Semantics (WFS).</i> While computation of
the well-founded semantics using tabling is quite complex, the
essential idea is that global information about dependencies is used
to determine the truth value of literals that do not have a
derivation. If such literals are involved in a cyclic dependency
through negation, they are undefined under WFS; if not, the literals
belong to an unfounded set and are false in WFS. In fact, it can be
shown that tabling allows non-floundering datalog programs with
negation to terminate with polynomial data complexity under the
well-founded semantics. A second feature to extend the power of
tabling is called <i>tabled aggregation</i>. If <i>partial order
tabled aggregation</i> is used, relations can be defined on answers in
a table such that only those which are optimal with respect to the
partial order need be retained.  If <i>functional tabled
aggregation</i>} is used, functions can be defined on answers to a
subgoal in a table so that an associative function &mdash; say a
maximum or least upper bound &mdash; of the answers is retained rather
than the set of answers themselves.</p>

<p>Using these features, XSB can serve as a development platform for
applications in two ways. First, applications can be programmed using
normal program clauses and the libraries of XSB. Second, XSB can serve
as the implementational infrastructure for useful logics which then
serve as the programming language for applications. These two choices
can be thought of as extremes, and most applications so far have used
a mixture of the two approaches.</p>

<p>We consider first the logics that have been implemented in
XSB. Based on XSB's implementation of WFS, the Well-Founded Semantics
with Explicit Negation (WFSX) has been implemented and extended to
allow abduction and logical program updates; the object-based Frame
Logic (F-Logic) and several temporal concurrency logics including the
Modal &mu;-Calculus and Concurrent Temporal Logic have also been
implemented using WFS, as described below. Using functional tabled
aggregation, Generalized Annotated Programs and a type of
probabilistic logic programs have been implemented; while using
partial order tabled aggregation a species of Preference Logic has
been implemented. Many of these logics become more powerful with the
addition of logical constraint handling techniques to XSB.</p>

<p>Before turning to applications of these logics we consider in
detail how XSB can form the underpinnings of a system based on a
non-traditional logical formalism using the case of FLORA, which which
amalgamates F-logic, Transaction Logic, and HiLog, and is implemented
as an optimizing compiler whose target code is a normal program
executable by XSB. Consider an F-logic term:

<ul class="code">
  <li>
  <b>john[spouse->mary, child->>{bob,bill}]</b>
  </li>
</ul>

which indicates that the object&nbsp; <b class="code">john </b>has a
spouse-attribute of <b class="code">mary</b> and children-attributes<b
class="code"> bob</b> and <b class="code">bill</b>. This term is
translated into a conjunction of triples:

<ul class="code">
  <li>
  <b>fd(john,spouse,mary)</b>
  </li>
  <li>
  <b>mvd(john,child,bob)</b>
  </li>
  <li>
  <b>mvd(john,child,bill)</b>
  </li>
</ul>

While this plan seems straightforward, it is hard to realize in a
standard Prolog framework. The main reason is that the translation
into XSB uses only a small number of predicates, which leads to two
main problems: (1) The loss of indexing; and (2) Termination
problems.</p>

<p>The first problem cannot be easily solved by increasing the number
of predicates, because of the meta-programming features of
F-logic. However, FLORA takes advantage of the various optimization
techniques that exist in XSB, such as <i>specialization</i> and
<i>unification factoring</i>.  The second problem is more serious: the
small number of predicates used in the translation makes even
non-recursive FLORA programs into highly recursive XSB programs. In
this situation it is hard to build a compiler that would produce
programs with reasonable termination behavior without tabling.</p>

<p>The profusion of logics implementable in XSB has led to a
proliferation of research and commercial applications, many of them in
areas in which logic programming has not previously been
successful. Using XSB, WFSX has been used for machine learning. With
the addition of abduction, WFSX has been used for psychiatric
diagnosis, as well as for fault diagnosis in electronic
circuits. FLORA has been widely used for the creation of Web agents,
for applications in neuroscience, and for processing ontologies and
meta-data.  Probabilistic logic programs have been used to allow mined
association rules to be used within an intensional
database. Preference Logic Programs have been used to for data
cleaning through the formalism of Preference Logic Grammars. These
applications typically mix the use of the various logics with
traditional Prolog programming techniques. XSB with tabled constraints
has been used for worflow rules for clinical oncology.  The reasons
for the success of each application varies. However, the use of XSB
for the verification of concurrent systems, or <i>model-checking</i>
illustrates many common features of these applications.</p>

<p>Model checkers are usually formulated in two stages. First there is
a <i>process logic</i>, representing the interaction of communicating
systems.  Common process logics are Milner's CCS (Calculus for
Communicating Systems) and the &Pi;-calculus. Abstractly, a process
logic can be seen as a labelled transition system consisting of a set
<i>S</i> of global system states and a labelled relation among
elements of <i>S </i>representing communications among the systems or
changes in the internal state of these systems. Transition systems
generated by process logics contain loops and so require a mechanism
like tabling even to be traversed. Temporal concurrency logics, such
as the Modal- &mu;-calculus and CTL* have been designed in order to be
able to query interesting properties of transition systems such as
whether termination occurs along all paths starting from a given
state, whether such paths are free from deadlock, are fair, and so
on. It can be shown that many concurrent temporal logics &mdash; such
as the non-alternating modal &mu;-calculus &mdash; can be embedded into
<i>dynamically</i> <i>stratified</i> logic programs, and can be
evaluated directly in XSB producing a two-valued well-founded
model. It is unknown whether general concurrent temporal logics, (such
as the alternating modal &mu;calculus) can be modularly embedded into
the well-founded semantics, but such logics have been evaluated by
using XSB as a preprocessor to a stable model generator. Thus in model
checking, XSB may be used alone or with other tools depending on the
needs of the user.  Recently, the addition of constraint domains,
implemented using XSB's CHR mechanism, has proven useful to reduce
state explostion when applying XSB-based model checkers to
verification of real-time and other concurrent systems. </p>

<p>Given its power and applicability, it has not been trivial to
implement tabling so that it is both efficient and integrable with
Prolog. Much of the work of the XSB group has involved design and
implementation of its underlying engine, the multi-threaded SLG-WAM,
and its extensions. From the point of view of implementation, tabling
has necessitated the development of algorithms in a variety of
areas. During a tabled evaluation, one computation path may consume
answers produced by another computation path. This means that
resources must be retained for environments that consume answers to a
given subgoal until they have consumed all answer that the evaluation
will produce for that subgoal. Furthermore, the evaluation must be
able to switch efficiently between computation paths that produce
answers and those that consume them.  These differences between tabled
and non-tabled evaluation have led to the study of strategies to
schedule the return of answers to consuming environments; the study of
how to efficiently determine when mutually recursive sets of subgoals
have been completely evaluated; and of how to perform efficient memory
management, environment switching and garbage collection.  Much work
has also been done on how to efficiently access tables from a
WAM-style engine, how to maintain dependency information in the table
(and stacks) for the well-founded semantics, and how answers in a
table can be efficiently shared among subsuming calls.  Finally, the
use of thread-shared tables provides a flexible mechanism for threads
to intercommunicate in multi-threaded applications, while the use of
thread-private tables allows for high scalability within a
multi-threaded process.. </p>
