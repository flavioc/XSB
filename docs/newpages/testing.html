<h1>Testing for XSB Releases</h1>

We provide here our checklist for release testing of XSB in order to
help users understand whether an interim release may be suitable for
them to download.  All of the tests below are run for each full
release (usually), and most are run for interim releases.

The main tests involved are
</p>

The <i>sequential</i> XSB test suite, which contains about 70,000+ lines of
code.  This test suite tests tabling and non-tabling features of XSB's
core engine and code, along with libraries and packages.  It can be
obtained through checking out the module <tt>xsbtests</tt> through anonymous
CVS.
</p>

<p>
The <i>multi-threaded</i> XSB test suite, which tests thread-safety
and concurrency features for the core engine and libraries, along with
threading, mutex, and message queue predicates.  It contains about
6000 lines of code, and can be obtained by checking out the
module <tt> mttests</tt> through anonymous CVS.
</p>

<p>
The <i>garbage-collection</i> test, in which the sequential test suite is run
with heap garbage collection invoked every 100 or so WAM instructions.
</p>

<ul>
<li>The sequential test suite under the following configurations is
run on Mac OS X, Linux, Windows-Cygwin and Windows-MSVC</li>
<ul>
<li>  32-bit mode, single-threaded, local evaluation</li>
<li>  32-bit mode, multi-threaded, local evaluation</li>
<li>  32-bit mode, single-threaded, batched evaluation</li>
</ul>
<li>The multi-theaded test suite, configured for 32-bit mode local
evaluation, is run on Mac OS X, Linux, Windows-Cygwin and Windows-MSVC</li>
<li>The sequential test suite is run under the following
configurations on Mac OS X and Linux</li>
<ul>
<li>  64-bit mode, single-threaded, local evaluation</li>
<li>  64-bit mode, multi-threaded, local evaluation</li>
<li>  64-bit mode, single-threaded, batched evaluation</li>
</ul>
<li>The multi-theaded test suite is run configured for 64-bit mode and
local evaluation is run under Mac OS X and Linux</li>
<li> The garbage-collection test of local evaluation are also run on
Windows and a Unix platform for 32-bit mode, single-threaded, local
evaluation</li>
</ul>
