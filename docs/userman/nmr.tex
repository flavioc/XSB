\chapter{Libraries for Non-Monotonic and Quantitative Reasoning} \label{library_nmr}
%====================================================

This chapter describes libraries, preprocessors and meta-interpreters
for non-monotonic reasoning.  We note that the implementation of FLORA
\index{FLORA} provides sophisticated capabilities for non-monotonic
reasoning and is described in a separate manual obtainable from {\tt
xsb.sourceforge.net}.
