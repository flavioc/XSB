    <h1>About XSB</h1>

<h3>
<a NAME="SECTION00002000000000000000"></a>Tabled Resolution</h3>
Tabled resolution is useful for recursive query computation, allowing programs
to terminate correctly in many cases where Prolog does not. Users interested
in Parsing, Program Analysis, Model-checking, Data Mining and Diagnosis
may benefit from XSB.
<p>XSB's Tabling implementation:
<ul>
<li>
Evaluates at the engine level programs with stratified and non-stratified
negation, and programs with stratified aggregation.</li>

<li>
Allows full Prolog functionality in tabled code including cuts, (subject
to weak semantic restrictions), in meta-logical predicates, in second-order
predicates, etc.</li>

<li>
Allows for declaration of tabled predicates either automatically by the
system or manually by the user. Furthermore, tabling can be automatically
performed for termination, for efficiency, or for both.</li>

<li>
Provides standard tabling predicates which can be used to program a number
of applications in Non-Monotonic reasoning and Knowledge representation.</li>

<li>
Dynamically compiles tables into trie-based SLG-WAM code. which is indexed
dynamically and for which full memory management is provided.</li>

<li>
Versions 2.4 and later have as default a tabling strategy called
<i>Local Evaluation</i> which is efficient for returning all answers
to a query, and is useful for applications such as program analysis
and non-monotonic reasoning.  As a configuration alternative, <i>
Batched Evaluation </i> is a Prolog-like tabling strategy that
efficiently returns the first answer to a query.

<li> Versions 2.5 and later have as their default stack management
configuration the SLGWAM configuration, for which a choice of three
heap garbage collectors are available.  An alternative stack
management configuration, Chat, is also available for which a choice
of two heap garbage collectors are available.
</ul>

<h3>
<a NAME="SECTION00003000000000000000"></a>Indexing and Dynamic Code</h3>
XSB contains a variety of features to support in-memory data-oriented applications.
Using these features, knowledge bases of up to one million clauses can
be quickly loaded and efficiently indexed.
<ul>
<li>
XSB provides a variety of read and assert mechanisms for quickly loading
dynamic predicates, especially if these predicates are unit clauses.</li>

<li>
Indexes can be created on alternate or joint arguments of dynamic code.
Furthermore this indexing can be hash-based, or trie-based if it is necessary
to perform indexing deep within a term.</li>

<li>
XSB provides mechanisms for backtrackable asserts: asserts whose
effects become undone upon backtracking.</li> 

<li>
For static code XSB provides <i>unification factoring</i> which extends
clause indexing by factoring common unifications out of clause heads, and
can be used to optimize many Prolog programs.</li>
</ul>


<h3>
<a NAME="SECTION00002000000000000000"></a>Interfaces</h3>
XSB supports a variety of interfaces.  All source code is available so
that the interfaces can be tuned as needed or ported to other Prologs.
</li>
<ul>
<li>
Interfaces to call C functions or to be called by them, under UNIX.</li>

<li>
An interface to Oracle that</li>

<ul>
<li>
efficiently generates SQL code for Prolog queries on-demand, making use
of Level 4 of Oracle's ProC.</li>

<li>
translates Datalog clauses into SQL automatically.</li>
</ul>

<li>
An ODBC interface, to call data stored by other Windows applications.</li>
<li>
A DLL interface so that XSB can be called from within a Windows application.</li>

<li>
      Java interfaces provided through <a
	href="http://dev.servisoft.pt/interprolog">InterProlog</a> and 
	<a href="http://www-db.stanford.edu/~stefan/rdf/yajxb/">
	      YAJXB</a></li>

<li>
Interfaces to libwww rourines and various pattern-matching utilities,
	      all of which are useful for Web applications.</li>

<li>
An interface to the stable model generator 
	      <a href="http://www.tcs.hut.fi/Software/smodels"> 
	      SModels</a></li>

</ul>

<h3>
<a NAME="SECTION00002000000000000000"></a>HiLog Compilation</h3>
HiLog supports a type of higher-order programming in which predicate symbols
can be variable or structured. This allows unification to be performed
on the predicate symbols themselves in addition to the arguments of the
predicates.
<p>XSB's HiLog implementation:
<ul>
<li>
Includes compiled HiLog. Higher-order predicates execute at essentially
the same speed as compiled first-order predicates.</li>

<li>
Includes a fully integrated HiLog preprocessor. HiLog terms can be used
anywhere in XSB, including the interpreter level.</li>

<br>Provides a number of meta-logical standard predicates for HiLog terms.</ul>
</ul>

<p>
XSB has been tested on over a dozen hardware and operating system
platforms under Microsoft Windows 95/98, Windows NT, Windows 2000 and
various versions of 32-bit UNIX. XSB 2.0 has been ported to 64-bit
architectures and has been tested on 64-bit SGI machines. Various
versions of XSB have been used to construct large-scale commercial
systems for the U.S. Customs Service, the U.S. Defense Logistics
Agency, the National Security Agency, Medicine Rules, Inc, MdLogix
Inc., and many others.
