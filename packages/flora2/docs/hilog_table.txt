TABLING HILOG PREDICATES
========================
Chang Zhao

/************ DEPRECATED (except flora_compiler_options) BEGIN *************/

1. Changes in the language
    1) Directives 'firstorder', 'firstorderall', and 'hilogtable' are no longer
       needed.
    2) The syntax of the directive 'table' is as follows:
	:- table P/N
       or
	:- table P/N/M
       where P is an atom or a variable, N and M are integers. The number of 
       slashs allowed is determined by FLSK_DEPTH in flrparser.P, which is
       currently 2.
    3) A new directive flora_compiler_options is added. See section 3 for
       details.
    4) get_residual@prolog(tables) is substituted by table_state@flora(sys).
       see section 4 for details.
    5) The syntax of index directive is now
	:- index N-M
       where both N and M are integers, 0<M<=N. See section 5.
      
2. How hilog table works (Coding Schema)
   The coding schema described below preserves the rule ordering and no
   run-time overhead is incurred.
   The basic idea is as follows. A rule number counter is maintained. In the
   rest of thie file, RULE# is used to denote the current value of this counter.
   The initial value for RULE# is 1.
   For a rule Head :- Body, 
   (1) The fingerprint of the head is computed.
       For example, the fingerprint for p(a) is p/1, and the fingerprint for
       F(X)(a,b) is F/1/2.
   (2) Check to see if some table directive subsumes the head fingerprint.
       If so, the rule will be translated as
		Head :- tabled_flapply(RULE#,...).
		table_flapply(RULE#,...) :- Body.
       and the rule counter is incremented.
       Otherwise, it is coded just as before: (Head :- Body).
       For example, if the user has X/1 and path/1/2 is tabled,
		p(a) :- body.
       will be translated into two rules:
		p(a) :- tabled_flapply(RULE#,p,a).
		tabled_flapply(RULE#,p,a) :- body.
       Whereas the following rule will stay as is.
		F(X)(a,b) :- body.

   tabled_flapply/2, tabled_flapply/3, ..., tabled_flapply/22 are tabled. 
   Compared with flapply/1 to flapply/21, the arities are 2 to 22 because of
   the rule number added as the first argument.

-----------------------------------------------
Example:

    :- table p/1.
    p(X) :- q(X).
    q(X) :- r(X).
    
    will be translated as
    
    flapply(p,X) :- tabled_flapply(1,p,X).
    tabled_flapply(1,p,X) :- flapply(q,X).
    flapply(q,X) :- flapply(r,X).
-----------------------------------------------

3. flora_compiler_options
   The coding schema interferes with XSB specialisation. Double-tabling 
   warnings are always given when something is tabled. Experiments show
   that specialisation doesn't speed up FLORA programs to any discernable
   degree. For these reasons, XSB
   specialisation is turned off by default. Users can use the directive
   flora_compiler_optoins to turn it on.
   The argument of the directive flora_compiler_options is a list
   of XSB compiler options. Basically these options will be dumped as is
   using XSB directive 'compiler_options'. The only exception is that
   if spec_repr doesn't appear in any list of flora_compiler_options, then
   compiler_options([spec_off]) will be dumped as well, which turns
   specialization off for FLORA programs.

4. table_state
   The coding schema, which wraps hilog stuff in the body using 'flapply',
   doesn't work for get_residual, which is exported by the XSB module tables. 
   get_residual(p(a),[])@prolog(tables) will be translated into
   get_residual(flapply(p,a),[]). Since flapply/2 is not tabled, a runtime
   error will be issued. table_state/2, which functions similarly, is 
   implemented in flora(sys). Basically for a user call
		table_state(Pred,List)@flora(sys)
   a new predicate is constructed from Pred:
	1) the outermost wrapper is tabled_flapply instead of flapply
	   (prefixed properly with flora prefix, module name, etc)
	2) a variable is inserted as the first argument, which matches all
	   rule number
   Then get_residual(NewPred,List)@prolog(tables) is invoked.
   For example, table_state(flapply(p,X)),[])@flora(sys) invokes
   get_residual(tabled_flapply(_RN,p,X),[])@prolog(tables).

   One problem with this implementation is that the result set may be
   incomplete. The reason is that the patch rules such as
	flapply(X) :- storage_find_fact(fdbtrie,flapply(X)).
   are not bridged by tabled_flapply.
   Our current solution is to add storage patch rules for table_flapply/2,
   tabled_flapply/3, ..., tabled_flapply/22.
	tabled_flapply(0,X) :- storage_find_fact(fdbtrie,flapply(X)).	
	tabled_flapply(0,X,Y) :- storage_find_fact(fdbtrie,flapply(X,Y)).	
	...
   Before get_residual is called, for example for p(X), tabled_flapply(0,p,X) 
   is completed. In this way, table_state can return the whole result set.

   Just as get_residual/2, the first argument of table_state should be defined
   as 'meta'. And it depends on the user to complete the call to the tabled
   hilog predicate in question.

5. index
   Now that 'index P/N' doesn't make any sense, index directive is changed to
	:- index N-M
   where N and M are both integers and 0<M<=N. Suppose N1=N+1, M1=M+1, 
   1) a compiler directive 'index N-M' is translated into 
		:- index FLORA_THIS_WORKSPACE(flapply)/N1-M1.
		?- index(FLORA_THIS_WORKSPACE(dyna_flapply)/N1,M1).
		?- index(FLORA_THIS_WORKSPACE(dynz_flapply)/N1,M1).
   2) an executable 'index(N-M)' is translated into
	(fllibprogramans((index(FLORA_THIS_WORKSPACE(dyna_flapply)/N1,M1),
			  index(FLORA_THIS_WORKSPACE(dynz_flapply)/N1,M1)),[])).

   dyna_flapply and dynz_flapply are wrappers for hilog rule heads of
   dynamically inserted rules. If a rule is inserted by insertrule_a, which
   means to insert the rule before all static rules, dyna_flapply is used. If
   a rule is inserted by insertrule_z, which means to insert the rule after
   all static rules, dynz_flapply is used. 

/****************************** DEPRECATED END *****************************/

1. Changes in the language
    1) Directives 'firstorder', 'firstorderall', 'hilogtable', and 'table'
       are no longer needed.
    2) Hilog predicates are tabled by default. Only hilog predicates led
       by '#' are not tabled.
       e.g. p(X) :- #q(X).
       =>   t_flapply(p,X) :- flapply(q,X).
       where t_flapply is the wrapper for tabled hilog and flapply is the 
       wrapper for non-tabled hilog predicates. Both of them are prefixed 
       with _$_$_flora_modspec_.

       Terms are always wrapped by flapply. For example, the term p(X) will
       be flapply(p,X), and the term #q(X) will be flapply(#,flapply(q,X)).

    3) import syntax
       import p/1 as ... from ... to import tabled p/1 
       import #(q)/1 as ... from ... to import non-tabled q/1 
    4) The syntax of index directive is now
	:- index N-M
       or
	:- index #N-M
       where both N and M are integers, 0<M<=N.

       Suppose N1=N+1, M1=M+1, 
       *) a compiler directive 'index N-M' is translated into 
		:- index FLORA_THIS_WORKSPACE(t_flapply)/N1-M1.
		?- index(FLORA_THIS_WORKSPACE(dyna_t_flapply)/N1,M1).
		?- index(FLORA_THIS_WORKSPACE(dynz_t_flapply)/N1,M1).
          a compiler directive 'index #N-M' is translated into 
		:- index FLORA_THIS_WORKSPACE(flapply)/N1-M1.
		?- index(FLORA_THIS_WORKSPACE(dyna_flapply)/N1,M1).
		?- index(FLORA_THIS_WORKSPACE(dynz_flapply)/N1,M1).
       *) an executable 'index(N-M)' is translated into
	(fllibprogramans((index(FLORA_THIS_WORKSPACE(dyna_t_flapply)/N1,M1),
			  index(FLORA_THIS_WORKSPACE(dynz_t_flapply)/N1,M1)),[])).
          an executable 'index(#N-M)' is translated into
	(fllibprogramans((index(FLORA_THIS_WORKSPACE(dyna_flapply)/N1,M1),
			  index(FLORA_THIS_WORKSPACE(dynz_flapply)/N1,M1)),[])).
