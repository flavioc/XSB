If you have downloaded this release of FLORA-2 from the home page at
http://flora.sourceforge.net or a development version from the CVS
repository on the same site, then you can configure FLORA-2 as follows.

1. Untar/download FLORA-2 into a directory *outside* of the XSB
   distribution tree, say FLORA:

   	cd FLORA
	tar xzf flora2.tar.gz  (use WinZip, under Windows)

   This will create a subdirectory, flora2; it is the top directory of your
   new installation of FLORA-2.

2. Configure FLORA-2 according to your environment, as explained at
   http://flora.sourceforge.net/installation.html


3. After the installation, the shell script `runflora' (runflora.bat under
   Windows) will be created. Use it to run FLORA-2.
