    This directory contains the XSB compiler code.

Type  `make' to recompile.

If some of the .O files get messed up as a result of a bug you
introduced, try to type `make restore'. The previously saved .O files
will be restored, so you might get a chance to fix the bug and
recompile XSB.


PLEASE NOTE:

If you change any of the files here (such as adding a new in-lined 
builtin), you must follow this procedure: 
 
          1. Recompile with the old, working XSB compiler. 
          2. ***Important*** Recompile again with a new compiler 
             obtained in Step 1. 
 
If you are adding a builtin to be used in the loader at an early stage, the 
procedure is more cumbersome. 
 
First, compile the ./cmp/*.P files with an old, working compiler. 
Then get a version of the loader (loader.O) that doesn't use the new builtin 
(pity you if you haven't saved the old one ;-). 
 
Now, compile ./cmp/*.P with the new compiler and the old loader.O. 
Finally, put the new loader.O in place and recompile ./syslib/*.P and 
./lib/*.P with the new compiler.  Easy, eh?
