This is a list of actions performed to create the XSB repository

Setting repository
==================
cvs -d ~/CVSROOT init

Make sure junk doesn't get added:
================================

Add file $CVSROOT/CVSROOT/cvsignore with this contents:

*.dvi *.aux *.log *.lof *.lot *.toc *.idx *.bbl *.blg *.ilg *.ind *.pdx
*.plg *.pnd *.ps *.so *.tar *.Z *.gz

Other .cvsignore files directly in the XSB source tree take care of the rest

Import
======

cvs -d /home/u17/sbprolog/CVSROOT import -W "*.xwam -k 'b'" -m "Imported sources" XSB  xsb start

-d sets CVSROOT
-W supposed to take care of binary files 
   (no key expansion, no newline conversion).
XSB is the subdir where XSB will be checked out
xsb vendor tag
start release tag


Setting modules
===============

cd XSB
cvs checkout CVSROOT

Then checkout and edit $CVSROOT/CVSROOT/modules. Add:


CVSROOT      CVSROOT
modules	     CVSROOT modules

xsbemu	     -d emu 	   XSB/emu
xsbsyslib    -d syslib	   XSB/syslib
xsblib       -d lib    	   XSB/lib
xsbcmplib    -d cmplib     XSB/cmplib
xsbpackages  -d packages   XSB/packages

xsbdocs	     -d docs       XSB/docs
xsbtests     -d tests      XSB/tests
xsbexamples  -d examples   XSB/examples

# Everything but admin, tests, examples, docs. Note: negated part comes first!
xsbcore	     -a !XSB/tests !XSB/admin !XSB/examples !XSB/docs XSB

# What developers need, sans XSB/tests, because of the size of XSB/tests
xsbdevel     -a !XSB/tests XSB

# This is how we'll be making releases
xsbrelease   -a !XSB/tests !XSB/admin !XSB/docs XSB



Tell CVS to watch XSB directory
===============================

Do this in a CHECKED OUT USER copy (of someone who created the
repository). Counterintuitive, but this is how it is done.

    cd XSB
    cvs watch on .

However, we must unwatch `tests' and all the object files to avoid errors
during testsuite runs and various compilations. In particular, the
repository is not set up to watch the testsuite. (Somebody wants to
tinker with tests/ to ensure that it will be watched and there won't be any 
errors?)

To un-watch the tests directory type:

   cvs watch off tests

Un-watch build/configure

   cvs watch off build/configure

Configure is in the repository for those who don't have autoconf
installed. However, it makes no sense to watch it, because it is generated
by autoconf.

To un-watch the object files, type:

   cvs watch off cmplib/*.xwam
   cvs watch off syslib/*.xwam

The last two must be repeated, if new files are added.
Please suggest a better way to set watches, if you know it.
(Note, the object files in lib/ and packages/ dirs are not in the repository,
so they don't need to be un-watched.)


Users must run cvs edit <file>, NOT chmod to make files rw.

Users add themselves to a watch list by executing
	cvs watch add -a all <files-or-dirs>

Others can see who's watching/editing with
        cvs watchers <files>
        cvs editors  <files>


CVSROOT/notify
==============

Uncoment the line to enable watchlist notification:

ALL mail -s "CVS notification" %s

Note, the line must look as above. The template file CVSROOT/notify
has a typo in it, where %s appears before -s, which will break the watch
mechanism.


CVSROOT/loginfo
===============

Uncomment the line:

DEFAULT	(echo ""; whoami; echo %s; date; cat) >> $CVSROOT/CVSROOT/commitlog

NOTE: the template file has a typo: it says "who am i" instead of "whoami".

In the future, should set commitlog per directory.

CVSROOT/cvswrappers
===================
Make sure binaries aren't broken during checkin/outs, etc.
