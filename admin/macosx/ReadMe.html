<h1>About XSB</h1>

<p><strong>XSB</strong> is a Logic Programming and Deductive Database
system for Unix and Windows. It is being developed at the <a

of the <a href="http://www.stonybrook.edu/" >Stony Brook
University</a>, in collaboration with <a
href="http://www.kuleuven.ac.be/" >Katholieke Universiteit Leuven</a>,
<a href="http://www.unl.pt" >Universidade Nova de Lisboa</a>, <a
href="http://www.uu.se/" >Uppsala Universitet</a> and <a

<h2>XSB Technical Summary</h2>

<h3>Tabled Resolution</h3>
<p>
Tabled resolution is useful for recursive query computation, allowing
programs to terminate correctly in many cases where Prolog does
not. Users interested in Parsing, Program Analysis, Model-checking,
Data Mining, Diagnosis and Temporal Reasoning may benefit from XSB.
</p>
<p>XSB's Tabling implementation:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
  Evaluates at the engine level programs with stratified and non-stratified
  negation, and programs with stratified aggregation.
  </li>
  
  <li>
  Allows full Prolog functionality in tabled code including cuts, (subject
  to weak semantic restrictions), in meta-logical predicates, in second-order
  predicates, etc.
  </li>

  <li>
  Allows for declaration of tabled predicates either automatically by the
  system or manually by the user. Furthermore, tabling can be automatically
  performed for termination, for efficiency, or for both.
  </li>

  <li>
  Provides standard tabling predicates which can be used to program a number
  of applications in Non-Monotonic reasoning and Knowledge
  representation.
  </li>

  <li>
  Dynamically compiles tables into trie-based SLG-WAM code. which is indexed
  dynamically and for which full memory management is provided.
  </li>

  <li>
  Has a default a tabling strategy called
  <i>Local Evaluation</i> which is efficient for returning all answers
  to a query, and is useful for applications such as program analysis
  and non-monotonic reasoning.  As a configuration alternative, <i>
  Batched Evaluation </i> is a Prolog-like tabling strategy that
  efficiently returns the first answer to a query.
  </li>

  <li> Has a default stack management
  configuration the SLG-WAM configuration, for which a choice of three
  heap garbage collectors are available.
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>
Support for Multi-Threading
</h3>
<p>
Beginning with Version 3.0, XSB supports a configuration that allows
multiple threads of computation within a single process under the
Posix model.

<ul>
<li>
All threads within the multi-threaded engine share the same static
code and I/O streams.  
</li>

<li>
For dynamic code or tables, predicates may be declared
thread-<i>private</i> or thread-<i>shared</i>.  Private predicates
are visible only to a given thread, and the space for private
predicates is reclaimed upon a thread's exit.  Thread-shared
predicates are visible to all threads.  
</li>

<li>
Within default local evaluation, concurrency for shared tables is
supported by an optimistic concurrency control called <i>shared
completed tables</i> which adds little overhead to computation.
Within batched evaluation, non-completed tables are visible to
multiple threads as well (this is experimental in version 3.0).
</li>

<li>
Posix-style operations are supported for XSB threads, including
joining and detaching threads, thread cancellation, etc.
</li>

</ul>

<h3>Indexing and Dynamic Code</h3>

<p>
XSB contains a variety of features to support in-memory data-oriented
applications.  Using these features, knowledge bases with millions of clauses 
can be quickly loaded and efficiently indexed.
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
  Indexes can be created on alternate or joint arguments of dynamic
  code. Furthermore this indexing can be hash-based, or trie-based if
  it is necessary to perform indexing deep within alternate arguments
  of a term.
  </li>

  <li>
  XSB provides a variety of read and assert mechanisms for quickly
  loading dynamic predicates, especially if these predicates are unit
  clauses.
  </li>

  <li>
  XSB provides mechanisms for backtrackable asserts: asserts whose
  effects become undone upon backtracking.
  </li> 

  <li>
  For static code XSB provides <i>unification factoring</i> which
  extends clause indexing by factoring common unifications out of
  clause heads, and can be used to optimize many Prolog programs.
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Interfaces</h3>
<p>
XSB supports a variety of interfaces.  All source code is available so
that the interfaces can be tuned as needed or ported to other Prologs. (as some
have been!)
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
  Interfaces under UNIX and Cygwin, to call C functions or to be called by them.
  </li>

  <li>
  An ODBC interface, to call data stored in a database accessable by an
  ODBC driver.  This interface translates Datalog clauses into SQL
  automatically.
  </li>
  
  <li>
    An alternate interface that supports access to multiple drivers,
    including mySQL drivers.
  </li>
  
  <li>
  Java interfaces provided through <a
  href="http://www.declarativa.com/interprolog">InterProlog</a> and 
  <a href="http://www-db.stanford.edu/~stefan/rdf/yajxb/">
  YAJXB</a>
  </li>

  <li> An interface to Perl, and especially to its pattern-matching
  facilities.
  </li>
  
  <li>
  Interfaces to libwww routines and various pattern-matching utilities,
  all of which are useful for Web applications.
  </li>

  <li>
  An interface to the stable model generator 
  <a href="http://www.tcs.hut.fi/Software/smodels"> 
  SModels</a> via the new <em>XASP</em> package.
  </li>

</ul>

<h3>HiLog Compilation</h3>
<p>
HiLog supports a type of higher-order programming in which predicate
symbols can be variable or structured. This allows unification to be
performed on the predicate symbols themselves in addition to the
arguments of the predicates.
</p>
<p>
XSB's HiLog implementation:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
  Includes compiled HiLog. Higher-order predicates execute at
  essentially the same speed as compiled first-order predicates.
  </li>

  <li>
  Includes a fully integrated HiLog preprocessor. HiLog terms can be
  used anywhere in XSB, including the interpreter level.
  </li>

  <li>
  Provides a number of meta-logical standard predicates for HiLog
  terms.
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Packages</h3>
<p>
In addition to those mentioned above, several important packages are maintained 
on top of XSB, inlcuding
<ul>
  <li>Flora: a highly sophisticated and efficient implementation of
             F-logic
  </li>
  <li>
    XJ: a system that allows XSB programs to create graphical sser
    interfaces based on Java's Swing package.
  </li>
  <li>XMC: a temporal-logic model checker for verifying properties of
           concurrent programs. and containing a graphical user
           interface.
  </li>
  <li>xsbdoc: a mechanism for generating manuals for XSB libraries and
             applications using principles of literate programming.
             Manuals can be generated in a variety of formats, including
             html, pdf, ps, and even ASCII text.
  </li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
XSB has been tested on over a dozen hardware and operating system
platforms under Microsoft Windows 95/98, Windows NT, Windows 2000 and
various versions of 32-bit UNIX. XSB also has also been ported to 64-bit
architectures and has been tested on 64-bit SGI machines. Various
versions of XSB have been used to construct large-scale commercial
systems for the U.S. Customs Service, the U.S. Defense Logistics
Agency, the National Security Agency, Medicine Rules, Inc, MdLogix
Inc., and many others.
