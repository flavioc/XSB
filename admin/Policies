Ways to Stay out of Trouble with CVS
====================================

1. Don't configure RCS or CVS to use local time --- always use
   Greenwich time. Since people work with XSB repository from different
   parts of the world, using local time could create havoc.

2. NEVER copy XSB files from somebody else's directory into your directory.
   This is dangerous, since changes made by somebody else can be lost if 
   you commit your local copy.
   If you need to integrate somebody's uncommitted changes, use Ediff to
   merge these changes into your files.

3. Always recompile your prolog object files before you commit changes into the
   repository.

4. It can happen that when you update your local copy of XSB with the files
   in the repository, you might not get the latest prolog object files.
   This is due to a deficiency with CVS binary file management.
   Solutions:
      a. Try to recompile your prolog object files by doing

	 cd <top xsb directory>
	 make force

      b. If this doesn't work, it means that prolog object files have
	 changed in incompatible ways. One solution to this is to delete
	 all your prolog object files and then update your copy using "cvs
	 update". This should replace your prolog object files with what is
	 in the repository. 

5. If you are going to make incompatible changes to prolog object files
   (like changing the format or adding builtins that are used in the
   loader), always notify the rest of the XSB group. Such changes must be
   synchronized, i.e., different people should not be doing such changes in
   parallel.
